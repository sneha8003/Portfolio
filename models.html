         <h3>Responsive</h3>
         <p>Responsive webdesign makes our webpage look good and is all about and using HTML and CSS to resize and fit in every devices.
         All the webpages that I have created are made responsive. And while the page is opened in smaller devices  then there are little  changes like the navigation bar shifts at the centre and the respective bar's active color green will become the row's full color.</p>
